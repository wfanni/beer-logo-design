# Simple logo design for "Beer Company"

The task was to create a simple logo depicting a pint of beer and making it interactive on a website.
It was early on in my frontend studies, so it is quite basic, but I had fun exploring mockups to create a deeper, "real" feel of the website.

You can see I have some versions of the logo and created a few more mockup pictures next to the one I'm using on the site.

Thanks for reading!
